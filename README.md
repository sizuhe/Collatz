- Implementation of the Collatz mathematical conjecture using a Hardware Description Language (HDL).
- This code takes a test value (`TB_SYSTEM_data_InBUS`) as an input and processes it into the Collatz series until it gets to 1. It can take multiple values in sequence as test values.
- It uses a state machine to handle different events based on whether the number is odd or even.
